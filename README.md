# Milestone Project-1
The objective of this project was to uncover insights related to employee performance, sales trends, customer preferences, and optimizing business performance. The goal was to provide actionable insights that could inform decision-making processes and improve strategic planning.

### Data Collection Method:
The dataset was provided by my tutor, Emmanuel Olujobi. The data included key variables such as company price, quantity and revenue which are relevant to analysing the sales per employee.

### Data Cleaning:
In this project, I addressed various data quality issues such as:
+ Missing values were dealt with using techniques such as removal of rows/columns, etc.
+ Duplicated entries were identified and eliminated to ensure data integrity.
+	I standardized inconsistent numerical values, and categorical entries to ensure smooth data processing.
+	Extreme values were identified and either treated or removed to prevent them from skewing the analysis.

### Data Visualization:
To make sense of the data and communicate the findings effectively, I employed various data visualization techniques:
+	**Bar Charts and Line Graphs:** These visualizations were used to track region by revenue over time, salesperson by price, and sum of revenue.
+	**Pie Charts:** I used pie charts to represent the distribution of salesperson by price 2.
+	**Interactive Dashboards:** I created interactive dashboards using Excel, pivot tables to allow users to explore the data dynamically.
